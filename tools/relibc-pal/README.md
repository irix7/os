# relibc IRIX 7 PAL

The native libc is the `irix7-pal` branch of
<https://github.com/irix7/relibc>.  The branch is the source of truth for the
PAL; this directory holds the pinned commit, the build script for the C probe
and a review mirror of the change.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Branch | `irix7-pal` |
| Commit | `d484536c49fed26a5377d2c511962b891e1c8dfb` |
| Series base | `a36041ac5201ede0c3853d548de5aa7fbfb0c708` |
| Mirror | [`patches/`](patches/) (`0001` functional, `0002` formatting) |
| Probe source | [`user/relibc-probe/probe.c`](../../user/relibc-probe/probe.c) |

The mirror is generated with `git format-patch a36041ac..d484536c` and applies
on top of `a36041ac`.  It exists for review; the build script pins and verifies
the branch commit, not the patch.

## What the branch changes

1. `syscall 0x1F7` replaces the flat provisional syscall.  The kernel returns
   `CELL_E_*` in `$2` and the value in `$3`; the PAL maps the status through
   `STATUS_ERRNO` to `Err(Errno(...))`.
2. relibc's 136-byte n32 `struct stat` is passed directly to `fstat`/`stat`.
   `KernelStat` and `copy_stat` are deleted.
3. `_start` builds the 16-byte main TCB (`self` at 0, `dtv` at 4, `errno` at 8,
   libc-private at 12) and sets `$28`.  `errno` and `__errno_location` are
   `TP + 8`.  MIPS III has no `rdhwr`, and the target has
   `has-thread-local: false`, so every `#[thread_local]` in the library becomes a
   plain static on this target.
4. `$a3` carries the auxiliary vector.  `_start` stores it, `Stack::auxv`
   returns it, and `getauxval` uses the native vector numbering.
5. `getdents` remains synthesised over the kernel's one-entry `readdir` call;
   there is no directory cookie to advance yet.

`futex_wait` and `futex_wake` are no-ops: the kernel has no futex and there is
one thread, so returning `ENOSYS` makes every mutex unlock panic.  `printf`
uses the generic path and now completes.

The target is `targets/mips3-sgi-irix7-native-n32.json`: n32, big-endian,
MIPS III, soft float, `-mno-abicalls -G0`.  The `std` shim remains the abicalls
exception.

## Build

```sh
# Pinned C toolchain: Bootlin mips64-n32--uclibc--stable-2026.08-1
# (GCC 15.3.0, binutils 2.45.1).  Pinned Rust: nightly-2026-05-24
# with rust-src, as in relibc's rust-toolchain.toml.
export MIPS_CC=/path/to/mips64-buildroot-linux-uclibc-gcc
export MIPS_AR=/path/to/mips64-buildroot-linux-uclibc-ar
export RELIBC_SRC=/tmp/opencode/relibc-pal-src

tools/relibc-pal/build.sh /tmp/opencode/relibc-pal-work/out
```

The script clones `irix7-pal` if `RELIBC_SRC` is absent, refuses to build a
different commit unless `RELIBC_COMMIT` says so, builds `librelibc.a` and
`libcrt0.a`, compiles the C probe, strips the ELF and pads a 256 KiB
`probe.raw`.  It records the relibc commit in `BUILD-PROVENANCE.txt`.  An
existing checkout needs its submodules initialised
(`git submodule update --init --recursive`).

## Run

Attach `probe.raw` as SCSI target 2 and boot the merged kernel:

```toml
banks = [64, 0, 0, 0]
no_audio = true

[machine]
profile = "indy_ip24"

[scsi]

[scsi.2]
path = "/tmp/opencode/relibc-pal-work/out/probe.raw"
cdrom = false
```

```sh
IRIS_NO_IDLE=1 iris --config probe.toml --ci --serial-log probe-serial.log \
  --monitor-port 18893 --ci-socket /tmp/opencode/relibc-pal-work/probe.sock \
  --prom rig/irix7-rom.bin --nvram probe-nvram.bin
iris-ci --socket /tmp/opencode/relibc-pal-work/probe.sock status --wait-ready 30
iris-ci --socket /tmp/opencode/relibc-pal-work/probe.sock start
```

The expected tail is:

```text
IRIX7-RELIB-PROBE-1
IRIX7-RELIB-PROBE-1: stat size=28 mode=100644 blksize=4096 blocks=1
IRIX7-RELIB-PROBE-1: tp=0x10026710 auxv pagesz=4096 failures=0
user: exit syscall code=0x00000000
kernel: userland returned to kernel console
```

The probe checks the marker write, `argc`/`argv`, `getpid`, `AT_PAGESZ`,
`AT_ENTRY`, `AT_CLKTCK`, `$28 != 0`, `__errno_location == TP + 8`,
`stat("/hello.txt")` fields, `fstat(999) == -1` with `EBADF`, and
`stat("/missing") == -1` with `ENOENT`.

## Limits

- Single-threaded: no threads, TLS block, signals or process table.
- `getdents` has one entry per call and no cookie; `lseek`, `pread`/`pwrite`,
  `dup2`, `fork`, `execve`, `waitpid` and the socket API remain `ENOSYS`.
- `getentropy` succeeds but the kernel zero-fills the buffer.
- `mmap` is the kernel's bump allocator; `munmap`/`mprotect` are metadata-only.
- The kernel's console/ramfs fd table is the only filesystem.
